# Chat-Java
A two way chat program written in JAVA using Networking.
There are Two Parts of this Repo:
  - One that runs on terminal
  - Another one is a GUI application

## NonGUI Application
Just clone this repo and go to the NonGUI folder.
Compile all the java files
```bash
  $ javac *.java
```
and run the **DemoServer.java** file first in one terminal window
```bash
  $ java DemoServer
```
and then run the **DemoClient.java** files in another terminal window
```bash
  $ java DemoClient
```
now you can type messages from both terminal window and see the chat!

_just type **quit** to exit_
## GUI application
Still Working on this one...
